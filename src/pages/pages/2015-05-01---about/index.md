Among long list of stupid things and lot of wasted time there are still
something I can speak about

As far as projects is not as interesting as developers like to think I would start from other
stuff ).

Things that I proud of:
* my super wife Tonia, she is my super star and the most lovely creature in the world
*  cat Kuzia, it is girl and she is very funny and angry
* I'm from village in the center of Ukraine and managed to finish the best Ukrainian technical
university and obtain masters degree. Later I realized and felt that studying at university is
rather like training your brain than obtaining a job
* I started to work directly with clients rather than on a big dev firm with lot of management stuff
between developers and clients

Things that I like to do:
* I like refactor code. I'm enjoin the look of code with lot of reusability and lot of little
functions =) I'm not ready to say that I position myself as a functional language developer, but
somewhy I like to bring a bit of functional stuff to the code.
* I like nice commits
* I prefer couple of simple APIs to one huge API if we talk about libraries
* I like data separated from functionality
* I like to learn something as needed and not because everybody interested in it
* I like learn from reading rather than lern from videos just because it is quicker for me

There are about 10 projects I successfully grew from scratch and supported in rapid development and 
production stages. Among them the most valuable for me are:
* Customer Engagement Management System - project for managing people resources built with
Angular 1.6 and Twitter Bootstrap from scratch. It was built for huge financial company CIS by Deloitte.
I consider this one like my programming school that takes me like a little child, teaches me the bast practices imagination, petience and team colaboration, and throw me then to a huge world of web development.
* [Staxter](https://staxter.com) - This is e-commerce platform, digital transformer that helps
people send money of other currency stuff to other people in a second. There is lot of other 
useful features. This is my playground as one of the main frontend web developer.
* [Tika](https://tika.ai) - This is my first project where I started to work as single frontend
developer. Also I bring my rules here and it is fun because I have my little kingdom here =)

This is my three big schools of project development.
